    ```
    *Replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username.*

3.  **Create a New Branch**
    Before making any changes, create a new branch for your feature or fix. Use a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-dark-mode` or `fix/event-date-bug`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name
    ```

4.  **Make Changes and Commit**
    Make your desired changes to the code. Once you're ready to save them:
    * Stage your changes:
        ```bash

        ```
    * Commit with a clear, descriptive message. We encourage using a prefix like **Fix:**, **Feat:**, or **Docs:**.

        git commit -m "Feat: Implement dark mode toggle for header"
        ```

5.  **Push to Your Fork**
